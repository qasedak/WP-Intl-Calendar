# WP Intl Calendar

WP Intl Calendar is a WordPress plugin that allows you to display dates and times in different calendar systems based on the user's locale. It leverages the JavaScript Intl API to provide accurate and localized date formatting.

## Features

- Convert dates to various calendar systems such as Persian, Islamic, Buddhist, Japanese, and Chinese.
- Automatically detect and use the user's locale or set a custom locale.
- Customize date and time formats including year, month, day, weekday, hour, minute, and timezone.
- Support for both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats.
- Specify custom CSS selectors to target elements containing dates for conversion.
- Display the date in desired language (match WordPress language or match with selected language).
- Auto-detect browser language.
- Automatic date detection for posts, comments, and archives.
- Performance optimization options for better site speed.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-intl-calendar` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the Settings -> Intl Calendar screen to configure the plugin.

## Usage

1. **Locale Settings**: Choose whether to automatically detect the user's locale or set a specific locale for date conversion.
2. **Date and Time Formats**: Customize the format for year, month, day, weekday, hour, minute, and timezone.
3. **Automatic Date Detection**: Enable this option to automatically detect and convert WordPress date elements (posts, comments, archives).
4. **Custom Date Selector**: Enter CSS selectors for elements containing dates, separated by commas. Default is `.date, time`.

### Performance Options

1. **Lazy Loading**: Only convert dates when they become visible on screen. This improves initial page load performance, especially on pages with many dates.
2. **Date Caching**: Cache converted dates to reduce server load by storing converted dates for reuse.
3. **Admin Area Conversion**: Choose whether to enable date conversion in the WordPress admin area. (Buggy and needs more testing)
