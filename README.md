# WP-Intl-Calender
WP Intl Calendar is a plugin that leverages the JS Intl method to display dates and times on WordPress in different calendar systems (currently supporting the Jalali Calendar).

- Dates on the front-end (v1.0)
- Dates on the WordPress dashboard post section (v1.03)
- in locale setting you can now select "Auto" and it will get wordpress locale automatically (better option for multi language websites) (v1.04)

This plugin is in development and not suitable for production-stage websites.
